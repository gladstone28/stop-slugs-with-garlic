Here’s a quick 5-step guide to using garlic to deter slugs in your garden:

Prepare a Garlic Spray:

Crush or blend 2–3 cloves of garlic.
Add them to 1 liter (about 4 cups) of water.
Boil the mixture for 10–15 minutes, then let it cool.
Strain and Store:

Strain the garlic solution to remove solids.
Pour the liquid into a spray bottle for easy application.
Store unused spray in the refrigerator for up to a week.
Dilute Before Use:

Mix 1 part of the garlic concentrate with 10 parts of water to avoid harming plants.
Apply to Plants:

Spray the diluted garlic solution onto the leaves, stems, and soil around your plants.
Focus on the base of the plants where slugs are likely to crawl.
Reapply as Needed:

Repeat the application every 2–3 days or after heavy rain to maintain effectiveness.
This method uses the strong scent and taste of garlic to repel slugs without harming beneficial insects or the environment.
